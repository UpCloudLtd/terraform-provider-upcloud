## Example Usage
{{ tffile "examples/resources/upcloud_storage/resource.tf" }}
{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}

## Notes
Please keep in mind that it's not possible to have a server with `backup_rule` attached to a server with `simple_backup` specified.
Such configurations will throw errors during execution.

Also, due to how UpCloud API works with simple backups and how Terraform orders the update operations, it is advised to never switch between `simple_backup` on the server and individual storages `backup_rule`s in one apply.
If you want to switch from using server simple backup to per-storage defined backup rules, please first remove `simple_backup` block from a server, run `terraform apply`, then add `backup_rule` to desired storages and run `terraform apply` again.

## Import
Import is supported using the following syntax:
{{ codefile "shell" "examples/resources/upcloud_storage/import.sh" }}
