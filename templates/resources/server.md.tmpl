## Notes
The idea behind simple backups is to provide a simplified way of backing up all of the storages attached to a given server.   
This means you cannot have simple backup set for a server, and then some individual `backup_rule`s on the storages attached to said server.  
Such configuration will throw an error during execution. This also apply to `backup_rule`s set for server templates.  


Also, due to how UpCloud API works with simple backups and how Terraform orders the update operations, it is advised to never switch between `simple_backup` on the server and individual storages `backup_rule`s in one apply.  
If you want to switch from using server simple backup to per-storage defined backup rules, please first remove `simple_backup` block from a server, run `terraform apply`, then add `backup_rule` to desired storages and run `terraform apply` again.  

## Import
Import is supported using the following syntax:
{{ codefile "shell" "examples/resources/upcloud_server/import.sh" }}
