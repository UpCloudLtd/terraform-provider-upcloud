## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "upcloud_server" "test" {
  zone     = "fi-hel1"
  hostname = "ubuntu.example.tld"

  cpu = "2"
  mem = "1024"

  # Login details
  login {
    user = "myusername"

    keys = [
      "<YOUR SSH PUBLIC KEY>",
    ]

    create_password   = true
    password_delivery = "sms"
  }

  storage_devices {
    # You can use both storage template names and UUIDs
    size    = 50
    action  = "clone"
    tier    = "maxiops"
    storage = "Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus)"

    backup_rule = {
      interval  = "daily"
      time      = "0100"
      retention = 8
    }
  }

}

```
