# upcloud_kubernetes_node_group (Resource)

This resource represents a node group in a Managed Kubernetes cluster.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create a network for the Kubernetes cluster
resource "upcloud_network" "example" {
  name = "example-network"
  zone = "de-fra1"
  ip_network {
    address = "172.16.1.0/24"
    dhcp    = true
    family  = "IPv4"
  }

  # UpCloud Kubernetes Service will add a router to this network to ensure cluster networking is working as intended.
  # You need to ignore changes to it, otherwise TF will attempt to detach the router on subsequent applies
  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [router]
  }
}

# Create a Kubernetes cluster
resource "upcloud_kubernetes_cluster" "example" {
  name    = "exampleapp"
  network = upcloud_network.example.id
  zone    = "de-fra1"
}

# Create a Kubernetes cluster node group
resource "upcloud_kubernetes_node_group" "group" {
  cluster    = resource.upcloud_kubernetes_cluster.main.id
  node_count = 2
  name       = "medium"
  plan       = "2xCPU-4GB"

  labels = {
    managedBy = "terraform"
  }

  taint {
    effect = "NoExecute"
    key    = "taintKey"
    value  = "taintValue"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `cluster` (String) Cluster ID.
- `name` (String) The name of the node group. Needs to be unique within a cluster.
- `node_count` (Number) Amount of nodes to provision in the node group.
- `plan` (String) The pricing plan used for the node group. You can list available plans with `upctl server plans`

### Optional

- `anti_affinity` (Boolean) If set to true, nodes in this group will be placed on separate compute hosts.
				Please note that anti-affinity policy is considered "best effort" and enabling it does not fully guarantee that the nodes will end up on different hardware.
- `kubelet_args` (Block Set) Additional arguments for kubelet for the nodes in this group. WARNING - those arguments will be passed directly to kubelet CLI on each worker node without any validation. Passing invalid arguments can break your whole cluster. Be extra careful when adding kubelet args. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--kubelet_args))
- `labels` (Map of String) Key-value pairs to classify the node group.
- `ssh_keys` (Set of String) You can optionally select SSH keys to be added as authorized keys to the nodes in this node group. This allows you to connect to the nodes via SSH once they are running.
- `taint` (Block Set) Taints for the nodes in this group. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--taint))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--kubelet_args"></a>
### Nested Schema for `kubelet_args`

Required:

- `key` (String) Kubelet argument key.
- `value` (String) Kubelet argument value.


<a id="nestedblock--taint"></a>
### Nested Schema for `taint`

Required:

- `effect` (String) Taint effect.
- `key` (String) Taint key.
- `value` (String) Taint value.
