# upcloud_server (Resource)

The UpCloud server resource allows the creation, update and deletion of a [cloud server](https://upcloud.com/products/cloud-servers).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "upcloud_server" "example" {
  hostname = "terraform.example.tld"
  zone     = "de-fra1"
  plan     = "1xCPU-1GB"

  template {
    storage = "Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa)"
    size    = 25

    backup_rule {
      interval  = "daily"
      time      = "0100"
      retention = 8
    }
  }

  network_interface {
    type = "public"
  }

  labels = {
    env        = "dev"
    production = "false"
  }

  login {
    user = "myusername"

    keys = [
      "<YOUR SSH PUBLIC KEY>",
    ]
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `hostname` (String) A valid domain name
- `network_interface` (Block List, Min: 1) One or more blocks describing the network interfaces of the server. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--network_interface))
- `zone` (String) The zone in which the server will be hosted, e.g. `de-fra1`. You can list available zones with `upctl zone list`.

### Optional

- `boot_order` (String) The boot device order, `cdrom`|`disk`|`network` or comma separated combination of those values. Defaults to `disk`
- `cpu` (Number) The number of CPU for the server
- `firewall` (Boolean) Are firewall rules active for the server
- `host` (Number) Use this to start the VM on a specific host. Refers to value from host -attribute. Only available for private cloud hosts
- `labels` (Map of String) Key-value pairs to classify the server.
- `login` (Block Set, Max: 1) Configure access credentials to the server (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--login))
- `mem` (Number) The size of memory for the server (in megabytes)
- `metadata` (Boolean) Is the metadata service active for the server
- `nic_model` (String) The model of the server's network interfaces
- `plan` (String) The pricing plan used for the server. You can list available server plans with `upctl server plans`
- `simple_backup` (Block Set, Max: 1) Simple backup schedule configuration  
				The idea behind simple backups is to provide a simplified way of backing up *all* of the storages attached to a given server. 
				This means you cannot have simple backup set for a server, and then some individual backup_rules on the storages attached to said server. 
				Such configuration will throw an error during execution. This also apply to backup_rules set for server templates.  
				Also, due to how UpCloud API works with simple backups and how Terraform orders the update operations, 
				it is advised to never switch between simple_backup on the server and individual storages backup_rules in one apply.
				If you want to switch from using server simple backup to per-storage defined backup rules, 
				please first remove simple_backup block from a server, run 'terraform apply', 
				then add backup_rule to desired storages and run 'terraform apply' again. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--simple_backup))
- `storage_devices` (Block Set) A list of storage devices associated with the server (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--storage_devices))
- `tags` (Set of String) The server related tags
- `template` (Block List, Max: 1) Block describing the preconfigured operating system (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--template))
- `timezone` (String) A timezone identifier, e.g. `Europe/Helsinki`
- `title` (String) A short, informational description
- `user_data` (String) Defines URL for a server setup script, or the script body itself
- `video_model` (String) The model of the server's video interface

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--network_interface"></a>
### Nested Schema for `network_interface`

Required:

- `type` (String) Network interface type. For private network interfaces, a network must be specified with an existing network id.

Optional:

- `bootable` (Boolean) `true` if this interface should be used for network booting.
- `ip_address` (String) The assigned IP address.
- `ip_address_family` (String) The IP address type of this interface (one of `IPv4` or `IPv6`).
- `network` (String) The unique ID of a network to attach this network to.
- `source_ip_filtering` (Boolean) `true` if source IP should be filtered.

Read-Only:

- `ip_address_floating` (Boolean) `true` is a floating IP address is attached.
- `mac_address` (String) The assigned MAC address.


<a id="nestedblock--login"></a>
### Nested Schema for `login`

Optional:

- `create_password` (Boolean) Indicates a password should be create to allow access
- `keys` (List of String) A list of ssh keys to access the server
- `password_delivery` (String) The delivery method for the server's root password (one of `none`, `email` or `sms`)
- `user` (String) Username to be create to access the server


<a id="nestedblock--simple_backup"></a>
### Nested Schema for `simple_backup`

Required:

- `plan` (String) Simple backup plan. Accepted values: daily, dailies, weeklies, monthlies.
- `time` (String) Time of the day at which backup will be taken. Should be provided in a hhmm format (e.g. 2230).


<a id="nestedblock--storage_devices"></a>
### Nested Schema for `storage_devices`

Required:

- `storage` (String) A valid storage UUID

Optional:

- `address` (String) The device address the storage will be attached to (`scsi`|`virtio`|`ide`). Leave `address_position` field empty to auto-select next available address from that bus.
- `address_position` (String) The device position in the given bus (defined via field `address`). For example `0:0`, or `0`. Leave empty to auto-select next available address in the given bus.
- `type` (String) The device type the storage will be attached as


<a id="nestedblock--template"></a>
### Nested Schema for `template`

Required:

- `storage` (String) A valid storage UUID or template name. You can list available public templates with `upctl storage list --public --template` and available private templates with `upctl storage list --template`.

Optional:

- `address` (String) The device address the storage will be attached to (`scsi`|`virtio`|`ide`). Leave `address_position` field empty to auto-select next available address from that bus.
- `address_position` (String) The device position in the given bus (defined via field `address`). For example `0:0`, or `0`. Leave empty to auto-select next available address in the given bus.
- `backup_rule` (Block List, Max: 1) The criteria to backup the storage  
		Please keep in mind that it's not possible to have a server with backup_rule attached to a server with simple_backup specified.
		Such configurations will throw errors during execution.  
		Also, due to how UpCloud API works with simple backups and how Terraform orders the update operations, 
		it is advised to never switch between simple_backup on the server and individual storages backup_rules in one apply.
		If you want to switch from using server simple backup to per-storage defined backup rules, 
		please first remove simple_backup block from a server, run 'terraform apply', 
		then add 'backup_rule' to desired storages and run 'terraform apply' again. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--template--backup_rule))
- `delete_autoresize_backup` (Boolean) If set to true, the backup taken before the partition and filesystem resize attempt will be deleted immediately after success.
- `filesystem_autoresize` (Boolean) If set to true, provider will attempt to resize partition and filesystem when the size of template storage changes.
							Please note that before the resize attempt is made, backup of the storage will be taken. If the resize attempt fails, the backup will be used
							to restore the storage and then deleted. If the resize attempt succeeds, backup will be kept (unless delete_autoresize_backup option is set to true).
							Taking and keeping backups incure costs.
- `size` (Number) The size of the storage in gigabytes
- `title` (String) A short, informative description

Read-Only:

- `id` (String) The unique identifier for the storage
- `tier` (String) The storage tier to use

<a id="nestedblock--template--backup_rule"></a>

Required:
