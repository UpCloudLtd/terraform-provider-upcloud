# upcloud_object_storage (Resource)

This resource represents an UpCloud Object Storage instance, which provides S3
compatible storage.

## Example

The following example represents an object storage instance called
`storage-name` in the `fi-hel2` zone, with 2 buckets called `"products"` and
`"images"`.

```hcl
resource "upcloud_object_storage" "my_object_storage" {
  size  = 250               # allocate up to 250GB of storage
  name = "storage-name"     # the instance name, will form part of the url used to access the storage
                            # instance so must conform to host naming rules.
  zone  = "fi-hel2"         # The zone in wgich to create the instance
  access_key = "admin"      # The access key/username used to access the storage instance
  secret_key = "changeme"   # The secret key/password used to access the storage instance
  description = "catalogue"

  # Create a bucket called "products"
  bucket {
    name = "products"
  }

  # Create a bucket called "images"
  bucket {
    name = "images"
  }
}
```
