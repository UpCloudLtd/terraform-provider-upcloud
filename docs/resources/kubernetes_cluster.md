# upcloud_kubernetes_cluster (Resource)

Kubernetes cluster. NOTE: this is an experimental feature in development phase, the resource definition will change in the future.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create a network for the Kubernetes cluster
resource "upcloud_network" "example" {
  name = "example-network"
  zone = "de-fra1"
  ip_network {
    address = "172.16.1.0/24"
    dhcp    = true
    family  = "IPv4"
  }

  # UpCloud Kubernetes Service will add a router to this network to perform some cluster networking magic
  # You need to ignore changes to it, otherwise TF will attempt to detach the router on subsequent applies
  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [router]
  }
}

# Create a Kubernetes cluster
resource "upcloud_kubernetes_cluster" "example" {
  name    = "exampleapp"
  network = upcloud_network.example.id
  zone    = "de-fra1"
}
```
