# upcloud_kubernetes_cluster (Resource)

This resource represents a [Managed Kubernetes](https://upcloud.com/products/managed-kubernetes) cluster.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create a network for the Kubernetes cluster
resource "upcloud_network" "example" {
  name = "example-network"
  zone = "de-fra1"
  ip_network {
    address = "172.16.1.0/24"
    dhcp    = true
    family  = "IPv4"
  }

  # UpCloud Kubernetes Service will add a router to this network to ensure cluster networking is working as intended.
  # You need to ignore changes to it, otherwise TF will attempt to detach the router on subsequent applies
  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [router]
  }
}

# Create a Kubernetes cluster
resource "upcloud_kubernetes_cluster" "example" {
  # Allow access to the cluster control plane from any external source.
  control_plane_ip_filter = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  name                    = "exampleapp"
  network                 = upcloud_network.example.id
  zone                    = "de-fra1"
}

# Kubernetes cluster with private node groups requires a network that is routed through NAT gateway.
resource "upcloud_router" "example2" {
  name = "example2-router"
}

resource "upcloud_gateway" "example2" {
  name     = "example2-nat-gateway"
  zone     = "de-fra1"
  features = ["nat"]

  router {
    id = upcloud_router.example2.id
  }
}

resource "upcloud_network" "example2" {
  name = "example2-network"
  zone = "de-fra1"
  ip_network {
    address            = "10.10.0.0/24"
    dhcp               = true
    family             = "IPv4"
    dhcp_default_route = true
  }
  router = upcloud_router.example2.id
}

resource "upcloud_kubernetes_cluster" "example2" {
  name                = "example2-cluster"
  network             = upcloud_network.example2.id
  zone                = "de-fra1"
  plan                = "production-small"
  private_node_groups = true
}

## Schema

### Required Attributes

- `control_plane_ip_filter` (Set of String) IP addresses or IP ranges in CIDR format which are allowed to access the cluster control plane. To allow access from any source, use `["0.0.0.0/0"]`. To deny access from all sources, use `[]`. Values set here do not restrict access to node groups or exposed Kubernetes services.
- `name` (String) Cluster name. Needs to be unique within the account.
- `network` (String) Network ID for the cluster to run in.
- `zone` (String) Zone in which the Kubernetes cluster will be hosted, e.g. `de-fra1`. You can list available zones with `upctl zone list`.

### Optional Attributes

- `labels` (Map of String) User defined key-value pairs to classify the cluster.
- `plan` (String) The pricing plan used for the cluster. Default plan is `development`. You can list available plans with `upctl kubernetes plans`.
- `private_node_groups` (Boolean) Enable private node groups. Private node groups requires a network that is routed through NAT gateway.
- `storage_encryption` (String) Set default storage encryption strategy for all nodes in the cluster.
- `version` (String) Kubernetes version ID, e.g. `1.28`. You can list available version IDs with `upctl kubernetes versions`.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) UUID of the cluster.
- `network_cidr` (String) Network CIDR for the given network. Computed automatically.
- `node_groups` (List of String) Names of the node groups configured to cluster
- `state` (String) Operational state of the cluster.
