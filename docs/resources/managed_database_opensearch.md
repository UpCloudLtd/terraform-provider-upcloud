<a id="nestedblock--properties--shard_indexing_pressure"></a>
### Nested Schema for `properties.shard_indexing_pressure`

Optional Attributes:

- `enabled` (Boolean) Enable or disable shard indexing backpressure. Enable or disable shard indexing backpressure. Default is false.
- `enforced` (Boolean) Run shard indexing backpressure in shadow mode or enforced mode. Run shard indexing backpressure in shadow mode or enforced mode.
            In shadow mode (value set as false), shard indexing backpressure tracks all granular-level metrics,
            but it doesn’t actually reject any indexing requests.
            In enforced mode (value set as true),
            shard indexing backpressure rejects any requests to the cluster that might cause a dip in its performance.
            Default is false.

Blocks:

- `operating_factor` (Block List, Max: 1) Operating factor. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--properties--shard_indexing_pressure--operating_factor))
- `primary_parameter` (Block List, Max: 1) Primary parameter. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--properties--shard_indexing_pressure--primary_parameter))

### Nested Schema for `properties.shard_indexing_pressure.operating_factor`

Optional Attributes:

- `lower` (Number) Lower occupancy limit of the allocated quota of memory for the shard. Specify the lower occupancy limit of the allocated quota of memory for the shard.
                    If the total memory usage of a shard is below this limit,
                    shard indexing backpressure decreases the current allocated memory for that shard.
                    Default is 0.75.
- `optimal` (Number) Optimal occupancy of the allocated quota of memory for the shard. Specify the optimal occupancy of the allocated quota of memory for the shard.
                    If the total memory usage of a shard is at this level,
                    shard indexing backpressure doesn’t change the current allocated memory for that shard.
                    Default is 0.85.
- `upper` (Number) Upper occupancy limit of the allocated quota of memory for the shard. Specify the upper occupancy limit of the allocated quota of memory for the shard.
                    If the total memory usage of a shard is above this limit,
                    shard indexing backpressure increases the current allocated memory for that shard.
                    Default is 0.95.

- `shard` (Block List, Max: 1) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--properties--shard_indexing_pressure--primary_parameter--shard))

<a id="nestedblock--properties--shard_indexing_pressure--primary_parameter--node"></a>
### Nested Schema for `properties.shard_indexing_pressure.primary_parameter.node`

Optional Attributes:

- `soft_limit` (Number) Node soft limit. Define the percentage of the node-level memory
                            threshold that acts as a soft indicator for strain on a node.
                            Default is 0.7.


<a id="nestedblock--properties--shard_indexing_pressure--primary_parameter--shard"></a>
### Nested Schema for `properties.shard_indexing_pressure.primary_parameter.shard`

Optional Attributes:

- `min_limit` (Number) Shard min limit. Specify the minimum assigned quota for a new shard in any role (coordinator, primary, or replica).
                            Shard indexing backpressure increases or decreases this allocated quota based on the inflow of traffic for the shard.
                            Default is 0.001.
