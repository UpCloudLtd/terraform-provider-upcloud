# upcloud_managed_object_storage (Resource)

This resource represents an UpCloud Managed Object Storage instance, which provides S3 compatible storage.

## Example Usage

```terraform
// Create router for the network
resource "upcloud_router" "this" {
  name = "object-storage-example-router"
}

// Create network for the Managed Object Storage
resource "upcloud_network" "this" {
  name = "object-storage-example-net"
  zone = "fi-hel1"

  ip_network {
    address = "172.16.2.0/24"
    dhcp    = true
    family  = "IPv4"
  }

  router = upcloud_router.this.id
}

resource "upcloud_managed_object_storage" "this" {
  name              = "example"
  region            = "europe-1"
  configured_status = "started"

  network {
    family = "IPv4"
    name   = "example-private-net"
    type   = "private"
    uuid   = upcloud_network.this.id
  }

  labels = {
    managed-by = "terraform"
  }
}
```

- `configured_status` (String) Service status managed by the end user.
- `name` (String) Name of the Managed Object Storage service. Must be unique within account.
- `region` (String) Region in which the service will be hosted, see `upcloud_managed_object_storage_regions` data source.

### Optional Attributes

- `labels` (Map of String) Key-value pairs to classify the managed object storage.

### Blocks

- `network` (Block Set) Attached networks from where object storage can be used. Private networks must reside in object storage region. To gain access from multiple private networks that might reside in different zones, create the networks and a corresponding router for each network. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--network))

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) Creation time.
- `endpoint` (Set of Object) Endpoints for accessing the Managed Object Storage service. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--endpoint))
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `operational_state` (String) Operational state of the Managed Object Storage service.
- `updated_at` (String) Creation time.
