# upcloud_floating_ip_address (Resource)

This resource represents a UpCloud floating IP address resource.

## Example Usage

The following HCL example shows how to create a detached floating IP address.
```hcl
    resource "upcloud_floating_ip_address" "my_floating_address" {
      zone = "de-fra1"
    }
```

The following HCL example shows the creation of a floating IP address assigned
to a server resource.

```hcl
    resource "upcloud_server" "example" {
      hostname = "terraform.example.tld"
      zone     = "de-fra1"
      plan     = "1xCPU-1GB"

      template {
        storage = "Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa)"
        size    = 25
      }

      network_interface {
        type = "public"
      }

    }

    resource "upcloud_floating_ip_address" "my_new_floating_address" {
      mac_address = upcloud_server.example.network_interface[0].mac_address
    }
```
