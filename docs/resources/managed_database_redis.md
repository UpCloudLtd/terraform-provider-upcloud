# upcloud_managed_database_redis (Resource)

This resource represents Redis managed database

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Minimal config
resource "upcloud_managed_database_redis" "example_1" {
  name = "redis-1"
  plan = "1x1xCPU-2GB"
  zone = "fi-hel2"
}

# Service with custom properties
resource "upcloud_managed_database_redis" "example_2" {
  name = "redis-2"
  plan = "1x1xCPU-2GB"
  zone = "fi-hel1"
  properties {
    public_access = false
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Name of the service. The name is used as a prefix for the logical hostname. Must be unique within an account
- `plan` (String) Service plan to use. This determines how much resources the instance will have. You can list available plans with `upctl database plans <type>`.
- `zone` (String) Zone where the instance resides, e.g. `de-fra1`. You can list available zones with `upctl zone list`.

### Optional

- `maintenance_window_dow` (String) Maintenance window day of week. Lower case weekday name (monday, tuesday, ...)
- `maintenance_window_time` (String) Maintenance window UTC time in hh:mm:ss format
- `powered` (Boolean) The administrative power state of the service
- `properties` (Block List, Max: 1) Database Engine properties for Redis (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--properties))
- `title` (String) Title of a managed database instance

### Read-Only

- `components` (List of Object) Service component information (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--components))
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `node_states` (List of Object) Information about nodes providing the managed service (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--node_states))
- `primary_database` (String) Primary database name
- `service_host` (String) Hostname to the service instance
- `service_password` (String, Sensitive) Primary username's password to the service instance
- `service_port` (String) Port to the service instance
- `service_uri` (String, Sensitive) URI to the service instance
- `service_username` (String) Primary username to the service instance
- `state` (String) State of the service
- `type` (String) Type of the service

### Nested Schema for `properties`

Optional:

- `automatic_utility_network_ip_filter` (Boolean) Automatic utility network IP Filter
- `ip_filter` (List of String) IP filter
- `migration` (Block List, Max: 1) Migrate data from existing server (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--properties--migration))
- `public_access` (Boolean) Public access allows connections to your Managed Database services via the public internet.
- `redis_acl_channels_default` (String) Default ACL for pub/sub channels used when Redis user is created. Determines default pub/sub channels' ACL for new users if ACL is not supplied. When this option is not defined, all_channels is assumed to keep backward compatibility. This option doesn't affect Redis configuration acl-pubsub-default.
- `redis_io_threads` (Number) Redis IO thread count.
- `redis_lfu_decay_time` (Number) LFU maxmemory-policy counter decay time in minutes. Default is 1.
- `redis_lfu_log_factor` (Number) Counter logarithm factor for volatile-lfu and allkeys-lfu maxmemory-policies. Default is 10.
- `redis_maxmemory_policy` (String) Redis maxmemory-policy. Default is `noeviction`.
- `redis_notify_keyspace_events` (String) Set notify-keyspace-events option. Default is "".
- `redis_number_of_databases` (Number) Number of redis databases. Set number of redis databases. Changing this will cause a restart of redis service.
- `redis_persistence` (String) Redis persistence. When persistence is 'rdb', Redis does RDB dumps each 10 minutes if any key is changed. Also RDB dumps are done according to backup schedule for backup purposes. When persistence is 'off', no RDB dumps and backups are done, so data can be lost at any moment if service is restarted for any reason, or if service is powered off. Also service can't be forked.
- `redis_pubsub_client_output_buffer_limit` (Number) Pub/sub client output buffer hard limit in MB. Set output buffer limit for pub / sub clients in MB. The value is the hard limit, the soft limit is 1/4 of the hard limit. When setting the limit, be mindful of the available memory in the selected service plan.
- `redis_ssl` (Boolean) Require SSL to access Redis. Default is `true`.
- `redis_timeout` (Number) Redis idle connection timeout in seconds. Default is 300.

- `password` (String, Sensitive) Password for authentication with the server where to migrate data from
- `port` (Number) Port number of the server where to migrate data from
