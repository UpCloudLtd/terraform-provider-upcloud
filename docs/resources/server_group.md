## Schema

### Required

- `title` (String) Title of your server group

### Optional

- `anti_affinity_policy` (String) Defines if a server group is an anti-affinity group. Setting this to `strict` or `yes` will
	result in all servers in the group being placed on separate compute hosts. The value can be `strict`, `yes`, or `no`.

	* `strict` policy doesn't allow servers in the same server group to be on the same host
	* `yes` refers to best-effort policy and tries to put servers on different hosts, but this is not guaranteed
	* `no` refers to having no policy and thus no effect on server host affinity

	To verify if the anti-affinity policies are met by requesting a server group details from API. For more information
	please see UpCloud API documentation on server groups.

	Plese also note that anti-affinity policies are only applied on server start. This means that if anti-affinity
	policies in server group are not met, you need to manually restart the servers in said group,
	for example via API, UpCloud Control Panel or upctl (UpCloud CLI)
- `labels` (Map of String) Key-value pairs to classify the server group.
- `members` (Set of String) UUIDs of the servers that are members of this group

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
