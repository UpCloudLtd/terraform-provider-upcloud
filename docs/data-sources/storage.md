# upcloud_storage (Data Source)

Returns storage resource information based on defined arguments.  

Data object can be used to map storage to other resource based on the ID or just to read some other storage property like zone information.  
Storage types are: normal, backup, cdrom, template

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Build server with your latest custom image 
#
# Note that when applied new updated image will cause replacement of the old server (debian.example.tld) with the new server created based on the updated image.
# This can cause posible data loss if it hasn't been taken into account when planning the service.
data "upcloud_storage" "app_image" {
  type        = "template"
  name_regex  = "^app_image.*"
  most_recent = true
}

resource "upcloud_server" "example" {
  hostname = "debian.example.tld"
  zone     = "fi-hel1"

  network_interface {
    type = "public"
  }

  template {
    storage = data.upcloud_storage.app_image.id
  }
}

# Build only new servers with your latest custom image 
#
# Use the lifecycle meta-argument to ignore changes in server's template triggered by new image version
resource "upcloud_server" "example2" {
  hostname = "debian.example2.tld"
  zone     = "fi-hel1"

  network_interface {
    type = "public"
  }

  template {
    storage = data.upcloud_storage.app_image.id
  }

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [template[0].storage]
  }
}
```
