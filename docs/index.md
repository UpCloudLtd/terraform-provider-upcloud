# UpCloud Provider

The UpCloud Terraform Provider enables organisations to control resources provided by the [UpCloud](https://upcloud.com/) platform.

## Configure provider
### Using environment variables
Define credentials using `UPCLOUD_USERNAME` and `UPCLOUD_PASSWORD` environment variables.  
```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    upcloud = {
      source  = "UpCloudLtd/upcloud"
      version = "~> 2.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "upcloud" {
  # username and password configuration arguments can be omitted  
  # if environment variables UPCLOUD_USERNAME and UPCLOUD_PASSWORD are set
  # username = ""
  # password = ""
}
```



### Using configuration arguments
```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    upcloud = {
      source  = "UpCloudLtd/upcloud"
      version = "~> 3.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "upcloud" {
  username = "<Your username>"
  password = "<Your password>"
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `password` (String) Password for UpCloud API user. Can also be configured using the `UPCLOUD_PASSWORD` environment variable.
- `request_timeout_sec` (Number) The duration (in seconds) that the provider waits for an HTTP request towards UpCloud API to complete. Defaults to 120 seconds
- `retry_max` (Number) Maximum number of retries
- `retry_wait_max_sec` (Number) Maximum time to wait between retries
- `retry_wait_min_sec` (Number) Minimum time to wait between retries
- `username` (String) UpCloud username with API access. Can also be configured using the `UPCLOUD_USERNAME` environment variable.

## Using the provider

### Requirements

* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.12.x or later


It's recommended to configure your credentials using environment variable:

```sh
export UPCLOUD_USERNAME="upcloud-api-access-enabled-user"
export UPCLOUD_PASSWORD="verysecretpassword"
```

To allow API access to your UpCloud account, you need to allow API connections
by visiting [Account-page](https://hub.upcloud.com/account) in your UpCloud
Hub. We recommend you to set up a sub-account specifically for the API usage
with its own username and password, as it allows you to assign specific
permissions for increased security:

1. Open the [People-page](https://hub.upcloud.com/people) in the UpCloud Hub
2. Click **Add** in top-right corner and fill in the required details, and
   check the **Allow API connections** checkbox to enable API for the
   sub-account. You can also limit the API connections to a specific IP address
   or address range for additional security
3. Click the **Create subaccount** button at the bottom left of the page to
   create the sub-account

Below is an example configuration on how to create a server using the Terraform
provider with Terraform 0.13 or later:

```terraform
# set the provider version
terraform {
  required_providers {
    upcloud = {
      source = "UpCloudLtd/upcloud"
      version = "~> 2.0"
    }
  }
}

# configure the provider
provider "upcloud" {
  # Your UpCloud credentials are read from the environment variables:
  # export UPCLOUD_USERNAME="Username of your UpCloud API user"
  # export UPCLOUD_PASSWORD="Password of your UpCloud API user"
}

# create a server
resource "upcloud_server" "example" {
  hostname = "terraform.example.tld"
  zone     = "de-fra1"
  plan     = "1xCPU-1GB"

  # Declare network interfaces
  network_interface {
    type = "public"
  }

  network_interface {
    type = "utility"
  }

  # Include at least one public SSH key
  login {
    user = "terraform"
    keys = [
      "<YOUR SSH PUBLIC KEY>",
    ]
    create_password = false
  }

  # Provision the server with Ubuntu
  template {
    storage = "Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa)"

    # Use all the space allotted by the selected simple plan
    size = 25

    # Enable backups
    backup_rule {
      interval  = "daily"
      time      = "0100"
      retention = 8
    }
  }
}
```

### Additional tooling

It is recommended to install the [UpCloud CLI client `upctl`](https://github.com/UpCloudLtd/upcloud-cli) to help out with
accessing information about your account and troubleshooting. For example, typically Terraform resources require parameters
that can be easily listed with commands such as these:

- [upctl server plans](https://upcloudltd.github.io/upcloud-cli/commands_reference/upctl_server/plans/)
- [upctl zone list](https://upcloudltd.github.io/upcloud-cli/commands_reference/upctl_zone/list/)

## Known issues
- `BACKUP_RULE_CONFLICT` when updating server `simple_backup` and storage `backup_rule` in one apply

  Removing `simple_backup` from a server and adding `backup_rule` to a storage attached to that same server in one apply operation will throw the `BACKUP_RULE_CONFLICT` error. This is caused by the fact that updating backup rules has to be done in a specific order that is not possible to achieve with Terraform. The workaround for this issue is to first remove `simple_backup` from the server, apply the change, and then add `backup_rule` to a desired storage and apply the change separately.
