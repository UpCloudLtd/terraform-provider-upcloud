# Pull through cache on an UpCloud Server

This example provides configuration for setting up container registry working as a pull through cache on an UpCloud Server.

The configuration provides the URL and password of the registry as `url` and `token` outputs, respectively. Use the values of these output to authenticate to the registry with, for example, `docker login` command.
